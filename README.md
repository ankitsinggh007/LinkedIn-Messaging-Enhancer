# LinkedIn Messaging Enhancer

This project enhances the LinkedIn messaging experience by integrating an AI-powered modal that assists users in generating responses to messages. The extension injects an AI icon into LinkedIn's message input area, allowing users to easily interact with the AI.

## Features

1. **AI Icon Injection**: The AI icon appears when the user focuses on the LinkedIn message input field.
2. **Icon Disappearance**: The icon disappears when the input field is no longer focused.
3. **Modal Display**: A center-aligned modal is displayed when the icon is clicked.
4. **Close Modal**: Clicking anywhere outside the modal will close it.
5. **User Input**: The user can enter commands in the modal's input field.
6. **Dummy Response Generation**: Clicking the “Generate” button displays a dummy response:  
   `Thank you for the opportunity! If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask.`
7. **Insert Message**: The generated static text can be inserted into the LinkedIn message input field when the "Insert" button is clicked.
8. **Non-functional Regenerate Button**: The “Regenerate” button is included but is non-functional.
